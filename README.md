# About
**Privacy-first identity verification**. 
This solution helps users convert verified identity claims into reusable, privacy-respecting digital badges that can be shared with landlords, employers, or anyone who needs background verificationâ€”**without handing over sensitive documents.**

## The Problem  
Every time you apply for a job, apartment, or various services (depending on where you are located), you're forced to surrender your passport, SSN, or ID. This creates:  
- **Identity theft risks** (Equifax-style breaches)  
-  **Privacy violations** (exposure of too much personal data)
